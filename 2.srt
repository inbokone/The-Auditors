1
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>[The Auditors]</i>

2
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:56,496
You were ultimately accountable
for the purchase of tower crane.

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,816
With that authority, you purchased a tower crane
not knowing the year of manufacturing at normal price.

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,480
The profit margin generated was dispatched to you
from Myoung Tower.

5
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:07,933
That defective tower crane eventually fell
and hurt a person,

6
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:10,457
and to hide that corruption,

7
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:13,605
you falsified the cause,
attributing it to the wind…

8
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,356
You're so funny.

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,527
Do you have any evidence?

10
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:23,223
Give me the laptop.

11
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:27,020
How dare you judge me like that
without any evidentiary support?

12
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:29,419
I will be compelled to report this slanderous remark
to the board of directors.

13
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:34,005
You'll be recorded
as the short-lived Audit Team Leader blown by me.

14
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:39,341
Someone concealed an injury
resulting from the tower crane accident

15
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,451
I think it's Mr. Bae, and what do you think?

16
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:59,247
It's the Vice President, you're in trouble now.

17
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:01,728
You'd better be careful.

18
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:12,157
How is everyone doing?

19
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:18,618
- Have you been doing great?
- Sure.

20
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,977
- Director Yang.
- Good to see you.

21
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:29,571
What are you doing? Come here and greet him.

22
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:33,593
- Who is he?
- Our new Audit Team Leader.

23
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,523
Oh, Audit Team.

24
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:44,663
Take a bow.

25
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:57,654
- What's wrong with his peepers?
- He's a wacko.

26
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:08,046
Follow us, hurry!

27
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:25,519
<i>[The Auditors]</i>

28
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:29,300
<i>[Vice President Hwang Dae Woong]</i>

29
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,589
That's what I did.

30
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:36,722
We should complete construction as soon as possible,
because it's a matter of astronomical amount of money.

31
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:41,569
The wind is strong.

32
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:44,569
Concealing a minor incident led to
the occurrence of a major accident.

33
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:46,780
- What accident?
- The audit work is underway.

34
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:49,366
- About whom?
- Seo Gil Pyo and Bae Young Sik.

35
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,736
The owner of Myoung Tower, and…

36
00:03:56,682 --> 00:04:00,128
- Me?
- Everyone involved in tower crane corruption.

37
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,496
Even directors, without exception.

38
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:08,675
Wow, you're an amazing one.

39
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:12,106
Where did Hwang Se Woong bring this talent?

40
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,285
Mr. Bae ran away.

41
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,737
One of the audit report items,
the laptop is also lost.

42
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,870
If you don't have anything to talk about,
I'll leave now.

43
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,104
Stop, you son of a bitch!

44
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,227
I used to talk like this before,

45
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:41,452
but now, I refrain from swearing
because I could be reported to the Ministry of Labor.

46
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,085
Listen, when I'm still this nice.

47
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:48,202
If the outcome proves inconsequential,
I will hold you responsible for making a fuss.

48
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:53,527
The Audit Team is directly subordinate
to the President.

49
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:57,457
Therefore, proceed accordingly
and allow the President to address the matter.

50
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,762
It's me.

51
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,423
I will hold you personally responsible.

52
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,899
I'm back.

53
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,457
- Where's Shin?
- He departed prior to me.

54
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,723
- Mr. Bae is missing.
- What?

55
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,068
He's gone even without paying the medical fee.

56
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:43,616
Maybe the tower crane gate is a real thing.

57
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,466
How was Shin and Myoung Tower?

58
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,887
I mean the 'laptop'.

59
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:50,208
What…

60
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,895
We should have a meeting now.

61
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:07,136
Mr. Bae, why did you fabricate
the cause of the overturn of the tower crane?

62
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,207
They said that if it were a natural disaster,
we could restart construction earlier.

63
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:15,879
The matter has been thoroughly discussed at all levels.
Do you genuinely believe I have the authority to decide it on my own?

64
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,910
Mr. Bae is missing.
He's gone even without paying the medical fee.

65
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:20,896
Maybe the tower crane gate is a real thing.

66
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,028
Someone is hiding the injury
happened by the tower crane accident.

67
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:29,216
I think it's Mr. Bae, and what do you think?

68
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,182
Those who ought to be audited are instead of tampering with,
pilfering, and absconding with evidence.

69
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:39,667
We must act swiftly,
lest all evidence disappears.

70
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,722
In case we fail in the audit, the repercussions
will directly impact the company.

71
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:47,539
So please, let's focus, everyone.

72
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:53,725
<i>[President Hwang Se Woong]</i>

73
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,716
You've scouted a new Audit Team Leader.

74
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,215
Why bother importing a hunting dog?
We already have plenty within the company.

75
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:11,865
Are you trying to screw me?
You're irritating Seo.

76
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,154
What does the audit of Director Seo
have to do with screwing you?

77
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:18,178
He can embezzle some.
Our father also allowed it.

78
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,545
- Not now.
- With whose permission?

79
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,178
Mine. I'm the President.

80
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:31,116
Sure, being the President is all.

81
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:40,710
On the day of the accident the tower crane cabin
was at the height of the 12th floor,

82
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:45,147
but the driver only broke one leg of his own.

83
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,625
12th floor is this room's height.
It must have been hard to avoid serious injury.

84
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,553
On the head part of the cabin chair,
some bloodstain was also found.

85
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:59,319
So the story is that Mr. Bae misrepresented how severe the injury
of the driver was, and he ran away for fear of it being revealed.

86
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:03,155
He's in charge of the site,
and he was fearful of being held accountable for it.

87
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:07,047
- Would that be the scenario?
- No, look.

88
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,905
If it was a serious injury,
why didn't we get the call from the hospital?

89
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,843
Can the hospital and Mr. Bae
collaborate to deceive us?

90
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,273
It's nonsense,
it was just an injury as it seems.

91
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,484
Have you interviewed the driver Choi?

92
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,398
How did it go?

93
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:25,492
Even without an interview,
do you believe that there is a low possibility of 1/1,000?

94
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:30,250
Let's go to interview him, right now.

95
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:34,961
Let's figure out why Mr. Bae fled away,
and if he had some unavoidable reason to do so.

96
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:41,515
I'll try to find him
by searching for the places he's likely to be.

97
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,663
Why don't we divide the team into groups?

98
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:47,398
Chief Ok and Assistant Manager Moon,
me and Seojin.

99
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:51,882
Then Goo Han Soo, with our Team Leader Shin.

100
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,194
Goo Han Soo will be transferred
to the other department after this audit finishes.

101
00:08:56,218 --> 00:09:01,897
This is a decision made by the team leader,
so please do your best and complete it until the end.

102
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:17,366
Shin Cha Il asked us to hand over the laptop.

103
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,229
That means he doesn't have it now, right?

104
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:25,783
Where the hell is it?
They say it's not retrieved.

105
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:31,251
Maybe some random person picked it up,
isn't that a better case?

106
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:35,595
It's not that simple, we must get it somehow.

107
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:42,408
I think you should talk about it
directly to the Vice President.

108
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,708
How can anybody drive a car with that condition?
I've just called a wrecker.

109
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:56,232
Please give me the key.

110
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:59,998
I've reserved a repair center
dedicated to our company.

111
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,584
It'll take some time.

112
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:06,841
I'll get you a company vehicle first.
Please wait for a moment.

113
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,865
Thank you.

114
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,474
You really didn't see the laptop?

115
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,568
I also don't remember anything
after I was dragged away by the gangs.

116
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:21,060
When I woke up, you were being passed out.

117
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:25,256
There is information needed
for completing the audit on the laptop.

118
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,084
Do you have that laptop?

119
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,834
I really don't know.

120
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,844
- It's your day, Choi.
- Open the door, it'll be a delivery.

121
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:44,941
- Let's go…
- Wow, you've got this.

122
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,199
- Hi, kid.
- Hello.

123
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:51,481
Excuse me, I'm looking for a driver Choi…

124
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,114
We're from JU Construction,
could you be our interviewee?

125
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:59,224
At that time,
we were getting to the salvage work…

126
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:02,521
and suddenly the gust blew it away.

127
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,512
I thought I was about to die,
I should have lived a more relaxed and joyful life.

128
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:07,848
I passed out with regrets…

129
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:10,356
and when I regained consciousness,
I found myself in a hospital.

130
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,215
You were very lucky.

131
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,239
How did you become acquainted with Mr. Bae?

132
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:19,169
He's the site leader
and I'm the driver, that's it.

133
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,013
You don't have any personal relationship with him?

134
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:25,059
Not at all. That's all I know, now can I go?

135
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,935
Yes, thanks for your interview.

136
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,099
Now it's clear,
because the accident victim testified himself.

137
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:36,334
He said that the cause was the wind,
and that's a lie.

138
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,000
He and Mr. Bae are in the senior-junior relationship.
He hid that fact as well.

139
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,999
Why didn't you point it out?

140
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:45,257
I just left him to talk because the audit
is limited to the partner company's employees.

141
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:51,656
Just… Could you tell me
what you're exactly thinking?

142
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,461
I fail to comprehend why you perceive everyone
as being dishonest.

143
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:02,328
What do you think
Mr. Bae's unavoidable reason is?

144
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:05,242
Maybe something happened to his family.

145
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,548
Some urgent issues could have happened,
and he's surrounded…

146
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:10,876
No, it didn't. Now you may leave.

147
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,843
I have examined all the places
where he is likely to be, such as his house,

148
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,030
his regular sauna and drinking house
and even team leader Gwak's house.

149
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,430
He's not there.

150
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:28,251
And what about his daughter's residence?
She's his only remaining family.

151
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,985
I couldn't dare to.

152
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,735
It makes things more complicated.

153
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,274
We cannot know anything
if we don't find Mr. Bae at the moment.

154
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,298
I'll go. I've met her previously.

155
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:42,165
Send me her address.

156
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,039
I got it.

157
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,492
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

158
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,430
We met at my wedding.

159
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:54,055
I remember my dad introduced you
as one of his favorite people.

160
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
Yes.

161
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:06,666
I'll present it to him as a birthday surprise,
so please keep it confidential.

162
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,048
Okay, uh…

163
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:16,432
Have you… talked to your father today?

164
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,775
No, I haven't. Why?

165
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,948
As you are his family, I'm telling…

166
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:29,330
Mr. Bae got hurt a bit and he's hospitalized.

167
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,135
Hospitalized?

168
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:37,080
It's never serious, but he left there suddenly,
so we'd like to know…

169
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,330
He doesn't answer.

170
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,627
Did something happen at the company?

171
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:06,499
There is information needed for completing
the audit on the laptop. Do you have that laptop?

172
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:09,132
- If you bring that laptop, you'll be transferred.
- I got it.

173
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:12,038
- Mr. Bae can be in his place again.
- I got it.

174
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:46,279
Thanks, have a nice day.

175
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,272
- I'm home.
- Have you eaten?

176
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:53,467
- I don't have an appetite.
- Something must be troubling you.

177
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,491
You're right.

178
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,803
A new team leader is almost exploding our team.

179
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,819
It seems as though he's always right,
and we're perpetually in the wrong.

180
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:11,538
However, what's really nagging me is
that he is right all the time.

181
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,468
That happened to me the same.

182
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:18,493
Whatever I do,
your mother always used to nag about it.

183
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,586
However, looking back,
she was right all the time.

184
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,367
Then she started to look attractive.

185
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:31,680
Just follow your leader, if he is right.

186
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:34,289
Here.

187
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,464
When did he lock it?

188
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,153
If the contract of tower crane…

189
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:33,856
Manufacturing year and parts prices
are all different.

190
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Good evening.

191
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,988
- Audit team?
- Yes.

192
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:05,214
- Your name?
- It's Goo Han Soo.

193
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:09,745
Okay, Goo Han Soo.
Everybody left, are you working overtime alone?

194
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:13,971
I have an errand to run at the Audit Office.

195
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,298
- I'd better go now.
- Okay, keep up!

196
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,848
Vice President.

197
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,136
Is it the laptop of Mr. Bae?

198
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,823
I think it's our team leader's,
because it's on his desk.

199
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:02,799
Han Soo, I'll ask again. Answer me carefully.

200
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:08,792
Is this Mr. Bae's laptop?

201
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:12,019
I…

202
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,683
I think it's our team leader's.

203
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:23,065
Here we need a huge replacement, right?

204
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:49,623
It's Shin Cha Il.

205
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:53,849
Sir, it's Goo Han Soo.
The Vice President got the laptop now.

206
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,919
He's getting out of the office
with it right now.

207
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,091
Vice President.

208
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,603
What a surprise,
how quickly information is delivered!

209
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:40,313
Please give me that laptop.

210
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,610
This is allowed by me, don't interrupt it.

211
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,274
Corruption can't be covered
with anybody's allowance.

212
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:53,220
- Are you really a Korean?
- Even damage to life could be involved here.

213
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:56,205
Give me that laptop.

214
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,284
You keep tackling me,
that reminds me of the old days.

215
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:07,832
When I was a Head Chief
some redevelopment for poor areas was delayed,

216
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:11,284
and the residents allowed only women
and children to confront the issue,

217
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:14,183
so that the hired gangs couldn't touch them.

218
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:18,308
It was clever, to a certain extent.

219
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,339
Do you know what I did?

220
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,340
I went there alone with a metal pipe
and knocked everything out.

221
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:47,847
I beat to a pulp whoever tackles me.

222
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:58,278
Don't tackle me,
if you don't want to be beaten like that.

223
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,871
Good morning.

224
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,280
- Has Mr. Shin come yet?
- He went to the site.

225
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,944
We also don't know why.

226
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:31,396
- What about driver Choi?
- He said he was lucky, but Mr. Shin said he was lying.

227
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,702
What lie? He's saying so
because he doesn't want to admit he's wrong.

228
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:39,571
Look, I was right for everything. Right?

229
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:42,288
You guys are too much obsessed with this.

230
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:53,146
Why aren't there any navigation systems
or black boxes present?

231
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,170
There used to be…

232
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:07,942
- Does that camera work?
- Yes, it does.

233
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,872
It might have filmed Mr. Bae
on the accident day.

234
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,915
He really did his best.

235
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:27,516
Please replay the video.

236
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,248
Mr. Shin, what brought you here?

237
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:47,834
I need a CCTV record video for the audit.

238
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:52,355
Doctor, is it possible to provide us CCTV video?

239
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,980
Of course, if you ask us to cooperate,
we should do so.

240
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:58,253
Thank you.

241
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,277
We ought to have a conversation first.

242
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,449
Happy birthday, darling.

243
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:21,274
He's the Audit Team Leader of the company,
and came to celebrate him representing the employees.

244
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,701
Stranger visitors have arrived,
yet Hwang Dae Woong remains unseen.

245
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,725
Avoid mentioning that in his presence.

246
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:33,382
Brother, he's really a talented Audit Team Leader.

247
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:37,882
It's going to be a new phase, so don't worry about it
and just work on your body.

248
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:45,840
Following my father's passing,

249
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:49,909
my brother had an accident 2 years
after he was promoted to President.

250
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:53,373
That's why I'm in charge of JU Construction now.

251
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,397
Dae Woong became a Vice President.

252
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,952
- Have you met him?
- Yes.

253
00:23:57,976 --> 00:24:01,397
He's a half-brother, and he's violent-tempered.

254
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:04,428
Substantially different from us.

255
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,444
I usually don't share private stories
with employees,

256
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:12,726
but I find myself wanting to discuss it with you.

257
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,796
You know I'm leaning on you a lot.

258
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,132
The initial impression is crucial,
so please give your utmost effort for this audit.

259
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,568
Damn…

260
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,959
Today is the birthday of President's brother.
Shouldn't you be there?

261
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:42,898
Are you that anxious? What a joke!

262
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:49,959
I burnt that laptop myself,
so just go ahead and do your work.

263
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:51,333
Did you burn it?

264
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:54,077
Why on earth are you expending energy on that?
You have your hands full with the apartment issues already.

265
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:58,061
Go for it, blow your worries away with this.

266
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:01,545
- What about Shin Cha Il?
- I'll fire him unconditionally.

267
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,749
Blow it.

268
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:11,826
Nice shot!

269
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:40,219
- Here, is what's brought from Mr. Bae's office.
- Thank you.

270
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:42,126
Why are you so serious?

271
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,578
I inspected on the accident day,
and discovered the timing to be rather inconvenient.

272
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:50,445
- Is it?
- The accident happened at 10:27 a.m.,

273
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:54,031
and the injured workers were transferred
to the hospital around 12 p.m.

274
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:59,102
However, the time driver Choi
was hospitalized was 4 p.m.

275
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:01,491
- Ah…
- It's longer than 5 hours.

276
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:05,226
Wait, it takes only 10 minutes
from the site to the hospital.

277
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,984
He might have suffered from pooping.

278
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,883
How can it take 5 hours?

279
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:14,594
Look, when people get injured,
their anuses get loose and keep pooping.

280
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:17,383
On and on, even after wiping it.

281
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:20,008
- Nonsense.
- Why nonsense?

282
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,360
The answer lies in simplicity.

283
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:29,449
Hello, this is the Audit Team.

284
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:33,322
Yes, sir. I got it.

285
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,253
What does Mr. Shin says?

286
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,285
He wants me to send him the address
of a worker called An Byoung Jin.

287
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,042
Who is An Byoung Jin?

288
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,630
- Is Mr. Shin going to his house?
- Maybe.

289
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:44,208
An Byoung Jin…

290
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:46,403
Good afternoon, this is Yoon SeoJin
from the Audit Office.

291
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:50,052
Can I have the address of our worker,
An Byoung Jin?

292
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:54,373
- Okay.
- Send it to me as well, please.

293
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:57,178
- Why, are you going to Mr. Shin?
- Yes.

294
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:59,185
Won't he be upset
if you leave without telling him?

295
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:05,107
What are you talking about?
He has to always stay close to him, good job.

296
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:10,512
SeoJin, I think that 5 hours is important.
Don't forget to send me the address.

297
00:27:34,326 --> 00:27:36,700
Sir!

298
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:48,244
Sir?

299
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,296
Are you there?

300
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,315
What's causing this unpleasant smell here?

301
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,933
Sir!

302
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:23,974
Did you find the laptop?

303
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:29,739
Here's the house of An Byoung Jin, right?
Why are you here?

304
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:33,247
Why did he leave the food until it decays?

305
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:37,427
- It's Shin Cha Il.
- This is Yoon Seo Jin.

306
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:42,396
I was checking the penalty bills of Mr. Bae,
and I found something strange.

307
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,154
He was caught on a speed camera
three times on Route 77.

308
00:28:46,178 --> 00:28:51,378
It was 11:10, 11:30, 11:55 each.

309
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:53,878
Three times in total, but…

310
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:58,495
I think the spots caught by the camera
are not the way from the site to the hospital.

311
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,620
On the day of the accident, Mr. Bae spent 5 hours
transporting Driver Choi to the hospital.

312
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:08,855
I think the reason lies here.

313
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,769
Thank you.

314
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,637
What happened?

315
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:28,478
Shall we go?

316
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,667
Why are we here?

317
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:30,002
Please tell me,
you told me to do my best and complete it.

318
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,002
I took this picture from that house.

319
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:47,253
An Byoung Jin, who really drove the tower crane
on the day of the accident.

320
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:51,589
But… driver Choi was driving the tower crane.

321
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:00,871
The person out of the tower crane is not
the person coming into the hospital.

322
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:03,368
Mr. Bae altered the individual involved.

323
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:07,305
What? This is Byoung Jin.

324
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:10,983
An Byoung Jin, is a driver of the tower crane.

325
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:14,110
Typically, he is not assigned tasks
due to his frequent errors.

326
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:18,446
Maybe that day was urgent,
so he drove the tower crane.

327
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,892
Then where is An Byoung Jin now?

328
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,446
From the field to this reservoir,
it takes one hour and thirty minutes.

329
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,470
From the reservoir to the house of driver Choi,
it takes two hours.

330
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:29,289
From there to the hospital,
one hour and a half.

331
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,813
The time earned from speeding
would be between 5 and 10 minutes.

332
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:36,514
It's a short time for digging up the ground.

333
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:39,826
Dig up the ground?

334
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,381
The hospital CCTV caught Mr. Bae's footprint.

335
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,655
He was here.

336
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,298
Mr. Bae was here? Why?

337
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:52,860
After the accident,
An Byoung Jin didn't come back to his house.

338
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:58,603
Are you saying Mr. Bae dropped him
into the reservoir here? No way.

339
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:04,650
No, even though I don't know him very well,
Mr. Bae is not a person like that.

340
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,975
You didn't know him at all.

341
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,056
I can say he didn't.
How could someone possibly behave in such a manner?

342
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,148
I saw the laptop.

343
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:21,570
I read the contract.

344
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:23,929
Since he was in charge of the field,

345
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:25,438
to exchange the tower crane's parts

346
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:29,193
he had that contract including actual parts
because they were needed.

347
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:31,217
He embezzled, however,

348
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,990
he would never commit such a crime.

349
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:36,748
That's why I judged you negatively.

350
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:40,526
Mr. Bae disregarded an employee
with severe injuries to conceal his own corruption.

351
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,292
Such behavior is deceitful
and jeopardizes the entire company.

352
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:52,673
- I report a missing person, this reservoir…
- There!

353
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:55,861
Let's give it a final attempt there.

354
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:59,087
It isn't late to report
after we check out there at least.

355
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,747
In the event Mr. Bae is present,
I am determined to ensure his voluntary surrender.

356
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,552
Give me one chance.

357
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,893
Excuse me, are there any inpatients here?

358
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:23,377
No, are you guys first here?

359
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,815
Truly, there are no inpatients registered?

360
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,524
I said no, what brought you here?

361
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,813
- Can I check just once in the patient's room?
- Hey, there's nobody!

362
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,970
- Please, let us check just for a moment.
- I said no!

363
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,617
Just one second!

364
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:03,117
Mr. Bae!

365
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:07,736
Just go, okay?

366
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,508
Did you bring a seriously injured person
to the internal medicine clinic?

367
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,532
Just leave!

368
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:31,985
Wait! Why are you doing this?

369
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:34,407
Han Soo, he's alive!

370
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,422
So just go away, then everything is okay!

371
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:40,274
You abandoned a seriously injured person,
and tried to cover up an accident.

372
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:43,749
Continuing like this,
we're essentially signing our own demise!

373
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:53,908
It's my daughter, isn't she pretty?
She's prettiest when smiling.

374
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:06,710
Mr. Bae, calm down and look at me.

375
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,889
Do you remember that time in front of the pub?

376
00:35:08,913 --> 00:35:11,624
You were so proud of your daughter
saying to me her smile is really beautiful.

377
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:13,991
She's now crying.

378
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:15,436
Why is she crying?

379
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,647
I visited her house trying to find you.

380
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:21,912
When I explained the situation, she cried.

381
00:35:26,412 --> 00:35:28,734
She's also pregnant!

382
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:33,685
You should return home to see your grandchild.

383
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:57,491
Damn, this broken crane…

384
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:45,585
Hey, what? Byoung Jin, wake up!

385
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:24,034
- <i>What?</i>
- Director Seo, I just…

386
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:26,985
Some accidents occurred.

387
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:32,876
Tower crane fell
and the driver seems to be dead…

388
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,147
Byoung Jin, Byoung Jin!

389
00:38:13,473 --> 00:38:15,476
Are you crazy?
Why the hell should I be hospitalized?

390
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,281
You said you wouldn't work
if you didn't get a kickback,

391
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:20,624
so Byeong Jin secretly changed
his turn and drove for you!

392
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:24,436
- Then you should've given it!
- What the…

393
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:29,449
Shall I inform your wife
that you've taken up gambling?

394
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,543
Or would you prefer I reveal
that you're losing half your salary to gambling?

395
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:37,270
Hey Yong Il, just one week.

396
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:40,910
All the money for compensation is for you too.

397
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:44,168
You're driving me to do something insane.

398
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:46,871
Where should I go?

399
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,862
I am sorry.

400
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:08,517
No matter how lucky it is,
it still has to break a leg at least.

401
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:15,126
The director said that construction
would be halted if there's a fatal accident.

402
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,737
Also, that I'd be arrested again.

403
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:19,228
So I just was afraid of it.

404
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:23,368
But how could you commit that big deal?

405
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,960
I desired to be of great assistance
for my daughter's wedding ceremony.

406
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:31,405
So I received the money from the Director.

407
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:34,739
Did you get the money from him?

408
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:38,146
I knew the tower crane was defective.

409
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,654
He also said that the workers
would become full-time employees.

410
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:48,795
Once I received that money,
I became a puppet for him.

411
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:09,548
Transfer him to Nasun Hospital.

412
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,928
There was an unpleasant issue at the company.

413
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:41,397
Fortunately, it wasn't a fatal accident
so I think we can move on quietly.

414
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:44,276
The problem is
the statement of the field director.

415
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,588
It shows it came from someone's orders.

416
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:56,360
When a person is cornered,
they can say everything.

417
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,046
So you're out of this?

418
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,320
Why on earth would I instruct
such a thing, for what?

419
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:06,052
Why should we care about a bastard
who ignored a dying person?

420
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:09,552
Let's host and serve the reporters
and finish smoothly here.

421
00:41:09,576 --> 00:41:14,170
The wall construction has been completed well.
Shall we provide some drinks to the workers?

422
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,946
Let's do it.

423
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,313
I ask for a special inspection
on Director Seo Gil Pyo.

424
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,163
The suspicions are
directed at Director Seo Gil-pyo.

425
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:32,906
Suspicion? How dare you!

426
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,703
A special inspection is…

427
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:39,570
where all major shareholders come from,
including the old Bang?

428
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:43,955
If you don't succeed in hosting
you could end up in disgrace, President.

429
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,647
Be prepared.

430
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,607
Oh, my.

431
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:13,819
I…

432
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:15,349
I wasted my life in vain.

433
00:42:16,885 --> 00:42:17,997
Don't worry about it.

434
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:22,414
Each time something went awry for me,
you were there to take care of me.

435
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:24,518
You even endured scolding
from my father in my stead.

436
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,326
This time…

437
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,520
I will repay you.

438
00:42:37,928 --> 00:42:39,140
He's a field director.

439
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:41,350
You could've just taken him to the hospital.

440
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:43,005
The disciplinary action
would have been minimal.

441
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:46,090
Sometimes, people make the wrong judgments.

442
00:42:46,114 --> 00:42:49,875
It's not the time to talk about such a thing.

443
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,851
We've got something related, too.

444
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,556
What do you mean by…

445
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:55,621
Yes, we have.

446
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:56,764
Right, we do.

447
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:58,175
Alcohol, transport expenses, gifts.

448
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:01,075
If they make issues of these,
it will become troublesome.

449
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:03,115
Hey, Goo Han Soo.

450
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,707
Did Mr. Bae mention us at all?

451
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:08,415
I need to get the laptop back.

452
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,262
What are you talking about?

453
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,725
Did he or did he not?

454
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:14,579
Hello.

455
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,580
How are you?

456
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:19,235
We'll conduct a special audit
of the Executive Director, Seo Gil Pyo.

457
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:21,969
March 13th at 2 p.m.,
in the main conference room.

458
00:43:21,993 --> 00:43:25,916
The CEO, executives and major shareholders
will be in attendance.

459
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,391
Please prepare thoroughly.

460
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:28,684
Yes, Sir.

461
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:34,995
It is truly absurd!

462
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:37,182
How on earth he conducts
a special audit of the Executive Director?

463
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:39,700
He's making a big mistake.

464
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:42,986
Shin Cha Il will get sacked off
this time for sure.

465
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,939
Please, Sir.

466
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:49,467
By the way, it would have been a disaster,
if we still had the laptop.

467
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:52,695
Vice President burnt it all.
He's unbelievable.

468
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:54,347
Watch your mouth.

469
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,626
Did the Vice President burn the laptop?

470
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,028
Did he really do that?

471
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,349
Oh, have a good day today, Sir.

472
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,838
- If…
- Let's go.

473
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:06,103
Come this way.

474
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:09,182
Goo Han Soo.
That's not what you need to care about.

475
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,296
What you need to care about
is your team leader.

476
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,605
You need to report his every move.
Do you understand, Han Soo?

477
00:44:16,227 --> 00:44:19,781
I sincerely regret following your counsel.

478
00:44:21,047 --> 00:44:23,296
Hey!

479
00:44:34,668 --> 00:44:36,668
Allow me to stop by for a short visit.

480
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:38,915
Mr. Bae.

481
00:44:40,237 --> 00:44:42,658
Hey!

482
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:44,136
How's Byung Jin?

483
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,003
He got a lot better.

484
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:48,683
They said he would get even better.

485
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,670
I shouldn't have done what was asked.

486
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:54,540
Seeing my daughter's face…

487
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:56,578
made me realize
that I really did something wrong.

488
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:58,147
You're right.

489
00:44:58,171 --> 00:44:59,855
You really did.

490
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:03,812
You need to be punished for what you did,

491
00:45:03,836 --> 00:45:05,860
but you shouldn't be punished
for what you didn't.

492
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:09,557
About the phone call
with the Executive Director that day…

493
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,067
Did you record it?

494
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:13,335
I haven't even thought about that.

495
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:33,113
Yes, it's Goo Han Soo.

496
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:44,464
<i>[The tower crane that was assembled
by importing parts from abroad…]</i>

497
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:47,551
<i>- [The lives of the workers…]
- [There is no standard for tower crane production…]</i>

498
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:49,809
<i>[Like a car accident and mortality accident…]</i>

499
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,886
<i>[The cause of the accident is deteriorating…]</i>

500
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,537
<i>[From the Tower Crane that's been approved…]</i>

501
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:11,978
Sir.

502
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,701
The President of Myeong Tower wants to
continue to do business with us,

503
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:20,963
and he said he would testify
at the special audit.

504
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,771
He will reveal all the bank account records…

505
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:28,125
And he emphasized
that the truth cannot be concealed.

506
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:36,999
I'm sorry I took the laptop.

507
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:48,986
I apologize, Sir.

508
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:15,618
Hey, long time no see.

509
00:47:15,642 --> 00:47:17,305
How are you doing?

510
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:23,241
When your father was here,
there were a lot of special audits.

511
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:26,022
Your father enjoyed bringing people together.

512
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:28,951
He is the President now,
you'd better use honorifics.

513
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:32,891
I used to change his diaper as well, though.

514
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:42,223
Don't make trouble.

515
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:43,721
Let's leave it as it is.

516
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:00,994
You must be nervous.

517
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,577
You should be.

518
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:07,031
You're about to get sacked off.

519
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:11,804
Listen, I'm really going to sack you off.

520
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:18,668
No, no way.

521
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:22,143
Workplace verbal abuse is the problem, right?

522
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:25,183
Call 15229000 and report it.

523
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:26,334
I'll admit it.

524
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:47,269
Why isn't Goo Han Soo coming?

525
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:48,635
I'll call him.

526
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:52,905
Thank you very much
for making the tough decision, sir.

527
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,320
I'm merely acting
in accordance with what's right.

528
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,243
Oh, the team leader is coming.

529
00:49:31,203 --> 00:49:33,598
I'm Shin Cha Il, the Audit Team leader.

530
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,203
Let's start the special audit.

531
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:38,995
January 16th, 2024, around 10 a.m.

532
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,066
At the site of the new construction
of the Info apartment building,

533
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,342
there was an accident
in which the tower crane fell.

534
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:47,076
The cause of the accident was
a defect in the tower crane…

535
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,147
which did not have a production certificate
and was not officially approved.

536
00:49:51,171 --> 00:49:54,988
It sounds unprofessional
to discuss in a special audit.

537
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:57,622
Our respected President and shareholders.

538
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:01,162
Regardless of the reason,
I apologize for bringing you here.

539
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:05,113
Our Audit Team leader is new,

540
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:06,823
so he's very passionate.

541
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,046
Historically speaking,

542
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:16,024
Tower crane is not obligated
to submit a production certificate…

543
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:18,929
as construction companies can't afford
to hold it due to the IMF.

544
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:22,254
As a result,
there is no public figure and it is old…

545
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:27,329
so that it's more difficult to find
a proper tower crane than a proper politician.

546
00:50:27,353 --> 00:50:28,578
Incorrect.

547
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:31,546
It's been a long time
since the production certificate has been mandatory.

548
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,631
We should have gone through
screening and discrimination…

549
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,768
to receive a defect-free tower crane.

550
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,883
It's over 700 billion won in construction.

551
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:40,734
Even a day delay is a huge loss.

552
00:50:40,758 --> 00:50:42,803
We had no time to think about a tower crane.

553
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,715
It's a matter of human life.

554
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:49,961
You're determined to make me
a very bad person.

555
00:50:49,985 --> 00:50:53,236
Annually, 2,000 individuals lose their lives
in traffic accidents.

556
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,012
Even if you have durable cars and safe roads,

557
00:50:57,036 --> 00:50:59,481
if you're unlucky, you die.

558
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,997
This accident is the case.

559
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:03,752
It's not such a widespread problem.

560
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:06,982
There are around 10 tower cranes used
for apartment construction sites.

561
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:11,013
As long as you stick to the principle,
it is sufficient to prevent accidents.

562
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:14,136
It's not a matter of luck.

563
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,311
You may think I'm irresponsible
because of what I mentioned.

564
00:51:16,335 --> 00:51:18,336
Because I mentioned luck.

565
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,122
No matter who chooses it,
the result is the same.

566
00:51:22,903 --> 00:51:26,301
Why did you pay for the price
of a proper tower crane?

567
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:30,622
Also, why did you receive the difference,
not depositing it to the company?

568
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:34,839
Did I get the difference back?

569
00:51:34,863 --> 00:51:36,121
Who says that?

570
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:40,395
The CEO of Myeong Tower who subcontracts
JU Construction's tower cranes will testify.

571
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:41,629
What?

572
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:47,954
Don't be nervous. You just have to be honest.

573
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:53,964
Are you setting me up?

574
00:51:56,134 --> 00:52:00,351
Why would I frame the Executive Director?

575
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,464
I'm here to express my gratitude to him…

576
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:07,576
for doing business with our Myeong Tower.

577
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:12,920
Sir, you said you have bank account records.

578
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:14,603
Did I?

579
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:16,627
I've never said that.

580
00:52:43,115 --> 00:52:45,626
The CEO of Myeong Tower
is not going to testify.

581
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:49,334
He made a promise to me.

582
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,333
He is related to Seo Gil Pyo,
so he must know we don't have the laptop.

583
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:55,037
Testimony promise is a trap.

584
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,610
You should search for alternatives
besides that.

585
00:53:08,058 --> 00:53:12,199
What kind of special audit is this?
It's a mess!

586
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:16,195
I don't think the CEO should have the right
to appoint the Audit Team leader.

587
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,449
There's one more employee
who's responsible for this accident.

588
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:46,055
It's Mr. Bae.

589
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,678
- Please, put this on.
- Mr. Bae who's in charge of the field was…

590
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:51,615
aware of the insolvency of tower crane.

591
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:53,991
And there was a person
who gave money and valuables to him…

592
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:55,882
to hide the truth.

593
00:53:57,911 --> 00:53:59,373
It's the Executive Director, Seo Gil Pyo.

594
00:53:59,397 --> 00:54:00,906
You're talking nonsense!

595
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,028
Hey, what's wrong with you?

596
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:04,101
<i>[Black box transcript]</i>

597
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,672
<i>Hello?</i>

598
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:07,890
<i>Executive Director, there…</i>

599
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:11,277
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

600
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:13,663
<i>The tower crane fell down.</i>

601
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:15,233
<i>The driver…</i>

602
00:54:15,257 --> 00:54:17,143
<i>seems to be dead.</i>

603
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:19,937
<i>What? Are you sure?</i>

604
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:21,937
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

605
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:24,898
<i>I'm transporting him in the car right now.</i>

606
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,627
<i>He is not breathing.</i>

607
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:30,434
<i>Has anyone actually witnessed him dead?</i>

608
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,981
<i>No one has seen it.</i>

609
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:37,947
<i>Bury him in a quiet place,
or throw him in the water!</i>

610
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:40,299
<i>- What?
- Handle the situation discreetly, ensuring no one finds out!</i>

611
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:42,007
<i>Sorry, what did you say?</i>

612
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,456
<i>You'd better get your head on straight.</i>

613
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,362
<i>If there's a personnel incident,
we'll need to go to the police.</i>

614
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:50,334
<i>Then, the money you and I took
from Myeong Tower will be revealed.</i>

615
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:53,310
<i>Also, it will be revealed
that we purchased the faulty tower crane!</i>

616
00:54:53,334 --> 00:54:58,306
<i>Then, you and I will have no chance
to see the sun again, okay?</i>

617
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,971
The conversation was recorded in the black box
on the day of the accident.

618
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:04,837
Mr. Bae tried to dump
the driver in the reservoir,

619
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,114
but he changed his mind.

620
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:11,373
Executive Director,
Seo Gil Pyo avoided his responsibility…

621
00:55:11,397 --> 00:55:16,862
by fabricating excuses disguised
as practice incidents or fortunate coincidences.

622
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:20,791
Then, he bribed the field warden
to commit embezzlement.

623
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:22,869
JU construction determines…

624
00:55:22,893 --> 00:55:26,093
that it can no longer accompany
Seo Gil Pyo, the Executive Director.

625
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:29,537
I speak to the Special Audit Committee.

626
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:31,179
To Seo Gil Pyo, the Executive Director…

627
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:36,850
I suggest the maximum penalty.

628
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,165
The criminal law will be executed
by the police who are waiting at the entrance.

629
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,436
Myeong Tower is a vice subcontractor
dealing trades in poor tower cranes.

630
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,498
We need to cut the deal
and file a claim for damages.

631
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:57,696
Yes, that's right.

632
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:02,931
And we're bringing disciplinary action
to the Vice President as well.

633
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:09,281
He has damaged the laptop which constitutes evidence
of corruption in the special audit.

634
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:11,419
There are two options.

635
00:56:11,443 --> 00:56:13,260
The first one is to pretend
that it didn't happen.

636
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:16,131
The second is to admit it and apologize.

637
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:17,963
If you choose the first one,

638
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:20,612
We will make the CCTV
of you burning the laptop public.

639
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,834
There are a lot of CCTVs at the site.

640
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,047
Please choose.

641
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,418
I apologize!

642
00:56:57,128 --> 00:57:00,159
This is what JU Construction should be.

643
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:28,495
The team leader told me
to find the black box.

644
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:31,697
He said Mr. Bae would know,
so I went to visit and asked.

645
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:33,587
He said he smashed
the black box completely,

646
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:36,007
and threw it away in the trash can
of the driver Choi's house.

647
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:37,390
So?

648
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:39,459
It's been more than a month.

649
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:42,848
What should I do?
I searched through the trash can.

650
00:57:42,872 --> 00:57:44,724
You know, the memory card is this small,

651
00:57:44,748 --> 00:57:46,951
and that was stuck beneath the garbage bin.

652
00:57:46,975 --> 00:57:48,130
I found it!

653
00:57:48,154 --> 00:57:50,825
Wow, that's amazing, Goo Han Soo.

654
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:52,399
- You look different.
- Thank you.

655
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:54,289
I'll give you that.

656
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:58,812
But what would have happened,
if we couldn't have found the black box?

657
00:57:59,832 --> 00:58:01,389
- Oh, my gosh.
- What do you think?

658
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:02,394
I'm sorry.

659
00:58:02,418 --> 00:58:03,705
Why are you freaking out?

660
00:58:04,556 --> 00:58:06,556
Our boss would have run away, then.

661
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,057
Get back to work.

662
00:58:09,081 --> 00:58:11,909
Don't make a fuss out of nothing.

663
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,610

We have a new Audit Team leader.

672
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,438
He gave me a three-month pay cut.

It's my son who's doing well.

685

He found the driver.

686
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:37,194
Otherwise,
the driver could have ended his life there.

687

My son knew he wouldn't have crossed the line.

Smiling.

- Yes, I have.
- Then you might understand.

701

Don't you think we audit office workers
are like the company's police officers?

No.

703

Audit office employees are office workers
who get a salary and work for private interest.

Anyone would resort to such measures
