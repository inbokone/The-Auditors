<i>[The Auditors]</i>

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:20.348
Nothing, right? Try to check this.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.596
Please approve this.

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.156
Isn't that the head of the inspection team?

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:35.132
Did someone make a mistake?

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:36.844
- Who?
- I don't know.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.320
He's going into Director Kang's room?

00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:50.479
What's wrong with you?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.813
Should I question you here?

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.534
Please tell me what's going on.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.221
I'm busy with the budget allocation.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.283
You forged a company stamp, right?

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:32.195
What?

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:44.010
You're saying that I made this?

00:04:09.494 --> 00:04:11.057
Finance Manager Kang Riquan,

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:13.940
September 17, 2 p.m.
at Namyoung Bank's Myeongdong branch,

00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:16.424
you created a fake account
using the company's name.

00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:19.550
After that, you designated a beneficiary
and made sure to deposit the money

00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:20.815
20 million won.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.269
Oh, I paid it back a month later
after cashing out the money.

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:25.729
Do you admit to embezzlement?

00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:27.084
Sir, sir!

00:04:27.922 --> 00:04:30.287
I have a disease
called thoracic aortic aneurysm.

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.146
It's a disease that costs a lot of money.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.396
I can't miss the treatment period
so I use the company's money first to get treated.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.927
To live, okay?

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.717
I did it because I'm trying to live.

00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:41.233
Please consider a leniency.

00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:49.389
You have two options.

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:51.162
First, you quit on your own.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:53.433
Second, the company will give you retirement
due to disobedience.

00:04:53.457 --> 00:04:56.548
If you choose the second one,
we'll proceed to the police station.

00:04:58.207 --> 00:05:00.134
Didn't I pay back the same amount?

00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:02.386
If the company lent it to me for a while…

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.363
The company is not a bank.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.699
Now choose. First or second?

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:08.285
It's one month. One month.

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.269
Didn't I put it back after a month?

00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:19.345
I've worked hard for 20 years.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.079
How can you kick me out so coldly
over a mistake?

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:31.556
Sir!

00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:37.188
My daughter is really good at ballet.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.578
If I quit the company here,
I will take away my daughter's dream.

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:43.109
What company would accept me at this age?

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.789
So, so, please.

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:47.297
Please save me, sir.

00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.742
Please, sir.

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.227
2 million won…

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.344
It was a test, wasn't it?

00:05:56.518 --> 00:05:57.541
Your objective is…

00:06:09.845 --> 00:06:11.626
a deposit for debt settlement

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.369
for 25 billion won.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:23.214
If this debt payment deposit is lost,
you know the company is going bankrupt, right?

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.973
With a forged stamp,

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:30.325
you want to creat a phisical account.

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:33.279
You even did deposit and withdrew rehearsal.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.574
It's a complete betrayal for the company
to entrust you with finances.

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:42.356
Sir, that's...

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:53.456
You're…

00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:55.777
taking away

00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:59.536
the dreams

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.575
of all the employees

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.068
in our company.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.691
You rat!

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:19.768
<i>[The Auditors]</i>

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:24.429
<i>[Episode One]</i>

00:09:04.247 --> 00:09:06.521
Sir, let's take a love shot together.

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.545
Oh my gosh!

00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:10.420
Oh, it's cold!

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:15.766
Since it's the last company dinner,
I feel like the beer is going crazy.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.728
Hey, I'm disappointed that it's the last one.
Sir, we're not going to see each other again.

00:09:19.752 --> 00:09:23.126
Let's see. Good job, everyone.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.712
Even if I leave,
you guys have to survive there.

00:09:28.244 --> 00:09:29.927
I really have a lot to say.

00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:32.610
I mean, CEO Hwang Se Woong,
what a shit of CEO.

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:36.068
The moment he was promoted,
he only thinks of himself.

00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:39.896
He treated our audit team leader coldly
and made him quit.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.623
Does this make sense?

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.304
But you'll be the team leader if I left.

00:09:43.328 --> 00:09:46.771
No, that's not what I'm saying right now.
You know that, sir.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.568
I'm just really sad.

00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:50.232
I'm upset.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:55.334
I heard it's because of CEO Hwang Se Woong
and Vice President Hwang Dae Woong's power struggle.

00:09:55.358 --> 00:09:59.486
Even if Hwang Se Woong is the president,
the vice president is still a big shot.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.392
You guys have to take the right side.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:05.588
Which side should I take then?

00:10:05.612 --> 00:10:08.104
Is it Hwang Se Woong or Hwang Dae Woong?

00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:13.179
Anyway, our audit team is dying
thanks to the fight between the two brothers.

00:10:13.203 --> 00:10:15.820
Chief, I'm here.

00:10:15.844 --> 00:10:18.244
- I will support you firmly from the back.
- Oh, that's nice.

00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:19.882
- Assistant Manager Moon,
- Yes?

00:10:19.906 --> 00:10:21.351
You're good at taking sides.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.521
Thank you.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:26.195
Then I'll side with the deputy manager.

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:28.476
See? Goo Han Soo, that was good.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.914
Hey, Goo Han Soo,
how could you left me and go to him?

00:10:30.938 --> 00:10:31.929
Of course.

00:10:31.953 --> 00:10:34.679
Manager, the deputy manager
is higher than the manager.

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:36.452
Do your best.

00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:37.996
Seo Jin, who do you want to side with?

00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:42.370
Well, does the side matter?
We are all in the same company anyway.

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:44.408
Oh, you're not fun.

00:10:44.432 --> 00:10:47.111
- Seo Jin is so smart.
- Thank you.

00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:50.306
Don't give your life to the company, either.
You'll end up like me.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.635
What are you talking about to the them.
We need to risk our life for work.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.900
You're here?

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.704
I heard you couldn't come
because you were doing overtime.

00:11:00.728 --> 00:11:05.158
How am I not coming when my friend is going?
I have to buy him some drinks, right?

00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:08.388
It's not like I'm dying.
Why are you consoling me.

00:11:08.412 --> 00:11:10.252
Just congratulate me.

00:11:10.276 --> 00:11:11.588
I'll pour you a drink.

00:11:11.612 --> 00:11:13.603
Oh, yes, yes.

00:11:13.627 --> 00:11:16.538
You'll have chicken for the side dish.

00:11:16.562 --> 00:11:21.006
Han Soo is always so sweet.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.124
I'm the one who raise him.

00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:25.730
You, even if I go, take care of my friend.

00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:27.464
Of course. Don't worry.

00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:30.745
- Okay, let's have a drink.
- Yes.

00:11:32.012 --> 00:11:33.096
Congratulations.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.815
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.933
I can't drink. I had to work overtime.

00:11:43.957 --> 00:11:45.510
Okay.

00:11:45.534 --> 00:11:48.495
Oh, is this my wife or a daughter?

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.878
Okay, I got it. Okay.

00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:53.815
Oh, why did you come out?

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.245
Did you talk to your daughter?

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:58.826
She's been nagging since she got married now.

00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:04.328
Look, my daughter is pretty, isn't she?
She's the prettiest when she smiles.

00:12:05.062 --> 00:12:07.788
But she doesn't look like you at all.

00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:10.309
That's why she's pretty.
She looks like her mom.

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:11.801
It's cold, let's go in.

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:13.217
No, I have to go.

00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.530
I paid all the tab. Yeah.

00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:16.717
I'm sure it costed a lot.

00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:18.483
Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:19.553
Thank you.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.412
It must have been hard for you
to work overtime these days.

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.694
It's okay, it's not even new to me.

00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:25.741
It must be hard for you.

00:12:25.765 --> 00:12:29.506
But I'm glad
that the Tower Crane incident ends well.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.607
Yeah, well, that's good.

00:12:30.631 --> 00:12:32.249
Oh, take this.

00:12:32.273 --> 00:12:35.841
You step on something on site last time
and you damaged your shoes.

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:37.485
Wear this.

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:40.376
Sir, sir!

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.165
Thank you so much.

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:44.305
What? You're thanking me?

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:45.329
Thank you.

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:47.498
Go have more fun. Yeah.

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:49.833
- It's too bad.
- I'm going to go.

00:12:50.654 --> 00:12:52.247
Sir, I'll treat this well.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.279
Okay.

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:01.817
Hey, let's have one more drink.

00:13:03.473 --> 00:13:05.301
Let's see each other again, okay.

00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:06.574
We will keep in touch.

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:08.262
Goodbye.

00:13:08.286 --> 00:13:10.802
- Now, Chief. Ok.
- Yes?

00:13:10.826 --> 00:13:11.817
Assistant Manager Moon.

00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:15.567
- What are you doing?
- Goo Han Soo, Yoon Seo Jin.

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:18.466
From now on, walk in a line. Let's go!

00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:21.246
I need to catch the last train. I'll go first.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.927
I have to go, too.

00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:24.270
I'll pay for the taxi.

00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:28.363
Sir! It's not the trend to hold onto the youngsters
just for drinks anymore nowadays.

00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:29.949
Let's go home now.

00:13:29.973 --> 00:13:33.567
Then, Mr. Moon, Mr. Ok, everyone, let's go!

00:13:33.591 --> 00:13:35.856
- Let's go. Let's go.
- No, I, sir…

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.973
Goodbye.

00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:38.301
Take care.

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:46.246
This? Mr. Bae gave it to me as a gift.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.442
Last time, I went to the construction site,
and my shoes were damaged.

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:52.350
Does audit department allow to receive that
from other employees?

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.834
I also gave the eel juice to Mr. Bae last time.

00:13:55.858 --> 00:13:58.842
I don't have any other hidden purpose.
It's just a gift, so what's the matter?

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:01.998
But we're working in the audit team.

00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:07.964
As the youngest member of the team, let's cheer up
so that we can maintain this good atmosphere.

00:14:07.988 --> 00:14:09.588
Love the country, love the team members!

00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:14.780
I love my country,
but why do I need to love my team members?

00:14:14.804 --> 00:14:17.272
It's just a company
that people go to earn money anyway.

00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:19.203
I'm going to go first
because of the last train.

00:14:19.227 --> 00:14:21.843
Oh, Seo Jin, wait a minute.

00:14:21.867 --> 00:14:24.389
Take a taxi with this.
We have money left in our expenses allocation.

00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:27.093
You were supposed to use this
when you're late for working overtime.

00:14:27.757 --> 00:14:28.757
That…

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.163
Company dinner is also one of the tasks.

00:14:32.187 --> 00:14:33.424
Go home safely.

00:14:35.516 --> 00:14:36.516
Okay.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.344
You're not going to work
just because the team leader leaves?

00:15:16.368 --> 00:15:20.422
I'll do that, so get ready to go to work,
Mr. Han Soo.

00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:23.101
I'll just help you with this, mom.

00:15:24.493 --> 00:15:30.006
By the way, since the team leader left,
will my son be able to work properly at the company?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.538
The audit office doesn't necessarily work
only with the team leader. We'll be fine.

00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:37.296
My son has grown up and goes to work now.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.805
When was it in high school?

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:42.907
It feels like it was only a few days ago when you went crazy
about being the white hacker or a white cracker.

00:15:42.931 --> 00:15:44.516
I'm proud of you, my son.

00:15:51.127 --> 00:15:54.134
That's right. I was going to be a white hacker.

00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:56.580
But back then, I was immature.

00:15:56.604 --> 00:16:01.588
I was in my teenage year,
so I didn't listen to you and just made troubles.

00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:02.627
Mom!

00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:07.275
- Dad!
- Who else are you going to give this money to?

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.001
It rained yesterday,
so the waste paper was all wet.

00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:13.941
If we give Ga Young's grandmother this 10,000 won,
she doesn't have to live without worrying about rain for three days.

00:16:13.965 --> 00:16:16.495
And it's okay for me to live in pain
for 30 years because of you?

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:19.722
But we get a pension.
We also got money from Kyung Ryul.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.636
When did Kyung Ryul even come?

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.769
Mom, mom, mom, dad will get hurt.

00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:28.839
Hey, you thief! Goo Seok Goo!

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:52.959
JU Construction shares fell to a new low today,

00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:54.896
are you okay?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.998
I have to be okay.

00:16:58.631 --> 00:17:00.659
You're good at breathing.

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:03.167
I was worried a lot when I heard it fall to 90.

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:07.620
I have to go to the company.

00:17:09.636 --> 00:17:11.836
I heard Hwang Dae Woong is
on an overseas business trip.

00:17:13.152 --> 00:17:16.978
The company isn't working well
because you give a lot of work to people like that.

00:17:18.322 --> 00:17:19.658
Don't give him work.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.259
I'm going to kick him out
as soon as he wakes up.

00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:33.116
Sir!

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.268
We're daily workers,
so instead of industrial accident treatment,

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:38.755
they said they'd give us a suspension in March.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:39.918
He's busy.

00:17:39.942 --> 00:17:42.293
The executive director said he promised,

00:17:44.006 --> 00:17:45.661
- Sir!
- Okay, I'll get back to you.

00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:47.552
The executive director promised us.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.755
What's going on?

00:17:51.793 --> 00:17:55.553
Oh, he's a worker of the Tower Crane incident,
and he said there's not much compensation given…

00:17:57.668 --> 00:17:59.582
I heard that we provided support
for treatment costs.

00:17:59.606 --> 00:18:01.831
I'm not sure about the details.

00:18:33.784 --> 00:18:35.917
Oh, fuck. Why there's no call coming?

00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:36.994
That scares me.

00:18:37.018 --> 00:18:40.698
Is this broken? Why can't I hear anything?

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:44.988
It has been a month since the team leader left,
but why they haven't contact me yet?

00:18:45.012 --> 00:18:48.018
Be patient. There will be good news soon.

00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:52.235
Don't worry, deputy manager.
You'll get there soon.

00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:55.048
- That's good.
- So, today's lunch

00:18:55.072 --> 00:18:56.954
should be paid by the reserve team leader.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:01.275
There's a revolving sushi restaurant that just opened,
should I make a reservation now?

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:02.681
No.

00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:09.157
- Omakase.
- Omakase.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:10.317
What do you think? It's okay, right?

00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:12.184
I'll just eat separately
in the company cafeteria.

00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:13.221
Ah…

00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:14.370
Yoon Seo Jin,

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.182
I'll give you one more.

00:19:18.034 --> 00:19:20.094
Just eat at the cafeteria. So much for sushi.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:23.182
I'm about to beat all of you. Go away!

00:19:23.206 --> 00:19:24.830
Oh, not again…

00:19:24.854 --> 00:19:26.463
There are still so many small dishes left…

00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:28.283
It's only this big,
and bean sprout as the side dish…

00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:30.838
Seojin, is the company's cafeteria really good?

00:19:30.862 --> 00:19:32.339
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:19:32.363 --> 00:19:33.908
There's nothing to eat.

00:19:33.932 --> 00:19:35.209
It's all dry and twisted.

00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:36.979
It's so insincere.

00:19:37.003 --> 00:19:39.542
It looks just like how much it costs,
the side dish…

00:19:39.566 --> 00:19:43.948
Is this a chick leg or a chicken leg?

00:19:43.972 --> 00:19:45.808
The soup is totally a dung soup.

00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:48.151
This for 7,000 won?

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:49.839
If you don't like it, you can eat out.

00:19:51.468 --> 00:19:52.447
What did you say?

00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:54.361
Sir, sir!

00:19:54.385 --> 00:19:56.557
Well, if you do this,
you won't feel good even if you leave work.

00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.206
The cafeteria is quite chaotic.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.300
The cyber audit department has filed a report,
so why hasn't it been addressed yet?

00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:05.167
Han Soo, shouldn't you the audit office
take the initiative here?

00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:07.370
How am I supposed to handle this?

00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:11.621
It must have been hard for the lady to cook,
let's just…

00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:13.809
The audit office is to be held accountable.

00:20:17.848 --> 00:20:20.591
There is no country of origin mark,
no ingredients are disclosure,

00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:23.780
poor taste and quantity.
There's a probability of embezzlement.

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:27.504
May I ask who you are?

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:29.222
I'm here for an interview.

00:20:29.246 --> 00:20:32.746
I was told that tasting the food gives you an idea
about the company, so I came to the cafeteria.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.993
JU Construction seems to have lost its taste

00:20:36.017 --> 00:20:37.562
because the audit staff is incompetent.

00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:38.827
Incompetent?

00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:43.477
Sir, if you come for an interview, your focus should solely be on that.
What kind of behavior is it?

00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:45.329
And if you knew me,
you wouldn't dare mention 'incompetent'.

00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:47.915
I'm going to be the audit team leader.

00:20:47.939 --> 00:20:51.134
I've never heard of incompetence in my life.
Is that so?

00:20:51.158 --> 00:20:54.193
If you've never heard of it, means
the people around you are also incompetent.

00:20:54.217 --> 00:20:56.451
Are you sure you're here for an interview?

00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:57.952
I wasn't informed of any of that.

00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:00.326
It appears they didn't inform you, which may speak
to their assessment of your incompetence.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.607
Excuse me.

00:21:01.631 --> 00:21:03.525
Hang in there, sir.
He's doing that on purpose.

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:05.451
He's just picking a fight on purpose.

00:21:05.475 --> 00:21:08.123
Hey, there's something you need to know.

00:21:08.147 --> 00:21:13.393
At JU Construction, we absolutely do not hire individuals
who spout nonsense and lack humanity.

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:16.338
If someone criticizes your work,
you should be thinking about correcting it.

00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:18.471
Talking about meaningless humanity?

00:21:19.823 --> 00:21:21.948
You just don't know how to audit.

00:21:21.972 --> 00:21:24.635
How do you know
that we're the staff of the audit office?

00:21:29.128 --> 00:21:31.432
Excuse me, we're asking you here?

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.678
Don't be disappointed if you fail the interview, whichever department you're in.

00:21:33.702 --> 00:21:35.702
It's an interview
for the audit team's team leader.

00:21:37.998 --> 00:21:39.076
Team leader Moon!

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.990
He said audit team's team leader.

00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:42.537
He's talking nonsense.

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:51.067
It's been vacant for a month
and we're interviewing external candidates?

00:21:51.091 --> 00:21:53.325
What a disgrace!

00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:56.755
I know, I think the boss has a different idea.

00:21:57.613 --> 00:21:58.614
Hey, you!

00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:02.887
Can't you see me?

00:22:03.981 --> 00:22:05.847
I was preoccupied with reviewing documents.

00:22:05.871 --> 00:22:07.075
This guy!

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.944
You claim to see documents but not me?

00:22:14.968 --> 00:22:15.952
No, sir.

00:22:15.976 --> 00:22:18.056
Send your name and department
to my secretary office.

00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:21.024
I'm sorry, executive director.

00:22:23.657 --> 00:22:25.508
I'm sad, too.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:31.929
In the past, I could fire you in one go,
but now it affects personnel evaluation.

00:22:39.767 --> 00:22:44.862
No, why did they even held an interview when they have me
who is not short of attitude, work performance, and work ability?

00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:46.793
No, why? Oh, you guys

00:22:46.817 --> 00:22:49.761
never doubted I'd be promoted
to team leader too, right?

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:51.309
This is weird.

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:54.442
There was no external recruitment information
for the audit team leader as far as I know too.

00:22:54.466 --> 00:22:55.797
Then it seems implausible.

00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:59.195
It's inconceivable that news of such significance
would evade Ms. Moon's attentive radar.

00:22:59.219 --> 00:23:02.266
I hold a reasonable assumption
that he must have been mistaken.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.743
- That's right.
- Wait!

00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:06.040
They're having an interview
in the small meeting room.

00:23:06.064 --> 00:23:07.504
Interview for the audit team leader.

00:23:08.314 --> 00:23:09.571
It got caught on the antenna.

00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:10.595
But, why?

00:23:11.587 --> 00:23:14.789
The position might already be filled internally,
and the ongoing interview could merely be a procedural gesture.

00:23:14.813 --> 00:23:16.343
What do you mean?

00:23:16.367 --> 00:23:19.546
He already knew we're from the audit team.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.632
That's probably because he heard Mr. Kim
talk about the audit office.

00:23:22.656 --> 00:23:23.929
He looked confident.

00:23:23.953 --> 00:23:26.210
Such rudeness can only be exhibited
by his confidence.

00:23:26.234 --> 00:23:29.835
Are you talking about dereliction of duty
or corrective action? It's all about work.

00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:32.652
Goo Han Soo,

00:23:32.676 --> 00:23:33.666
no, no.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.168
- No, you should go to the conference room.
- Me?

00:23:36.192 --> 00:23:38.870
Go see how things are going.

00:23:38.894 --> 00:23:40.425
- Make it a bit faster.
- Yes.

00:23:45.198 --> 00:23:46.761
What's your motive of application?

00:23:46.785 --> 00:23:49.388
I applied because I wanted to catch a rat.

00:23:49.412 --> 00:23:53.442
What? In today's world,
there are no rats in a building like this?

00:23:53.466 --> 00:23:55.388
And even if there's a rat

00:23:55.412 --> 00:23:57.700
we'll call a pest control to catch it.

00:23:57.724 --> 00:24:00.776
Why did you have an interview…
What are you talking about?

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.128
JU Construction has a lot of rats.
I'll change all the company if you want.

00:24:06.152 --> 00:24:09.190
Don't beat around the bush,
just say it directly.

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:14.555
In 2019, 700 million embezzled
for manipulating the balance proof system.

00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:18.024
In 2020, 900 million was embezzled
due to fabrication of stamp impression.

00:24:18.048 --> 00:24:21.399
And in 2021, 1.3 billion was embezzled
due to executive breach of trust.

00:24:21.423 --> 00:24:23.274
It was ground up by the rats.

00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:28.166
So you can stop it? How?

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.815
The manipulation of the proof-of-balance system
can be prevented by weekly financial audits.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:35.955
The fabrication of the stamp impression can be detected
in the early stages through a detailed audit of the account.

00:24:35.979 --> 00:24:39.955
Executive breach can be prevented
by activating special audits.

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:42.361
What purpose do such principled measures serve…

00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:45.493
JU Construction currently appears to
lack any substantial principled actions.

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:46.603
Oh, my!

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:51.419
You often change jobs,
is there a reason to that?

00:24:53.138 --> 00:24:56.027
After I catch all these rats,
I will change company.

00:24:56.051 --> 00:24:59.935
To a place where rats are swarming,
JU Construction.

00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:01.621
This guy!

00:25:01.645 --> 00:25:04.225
Sir, do I have to keep listening to this?

00:25:04.249 --> 00:25:09.671
JU Construction is a leading company in Korea's construction
and ranked 12th in the business world.

00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:14.312
If you want to regain that reputation
and not make your employees unemployed,

00:25:14.336 --> 00:25:16.296
you need to declare an emergency audit system.

00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:21.804
Before it's late.

00:25:27.953 --> 00:25:28.953
Hello.

00:25:29.844 --> 00:25:33.656
I heard that there's an interview
for the audit team's team leader?

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.820
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're interviewing inside.

00:25:35.844 --> 00:25:39.324
Seems like you're not here for an interview
You're here to give us a lesson, so get out.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.340
What happened?

00:26:00.364 --> 00:26:02.801
What is it? Hurry, hurry.

00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:03.879
That person,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.871
was kicked out.

00:26:07.746 --> 00:26:09.488
- It's done, right?
- I won't see him again.

00:26:09.512 --> 00:26:12.340
See. What did I say?

00:26:12.364 --> 00:26:13.371
I was right.

00:26:13.395 --> 00:26:15.887
Now I'm the team leader.

00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.238
Then, let's do our work.

00:26:21.217 --> 00:26:23.201
<i>Have a great day.</i>

00:26:23.225 --> 00:26:25.279
<i>Word of encouragement for today.</i>

00:26:25.303 --> 00:26:28.201
<i>Only I can make my life shine.</i>

00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:31.684
<i>Only I hold the power
to illuminate my own path in life.</i>

00:26:33.277 --> 00:26:35.981
Only I can make my life shine.

00:26:37.106 --> 00:26:40.395
Only I hold the power
to illuminate my own path in life.

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:51.808
Thank you.

00:26:57.841 --> 00:26:59.512
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:01.231
Hello.

00:27:01.255 --> 00:27:02.428
Hello?

00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:05.030
Hello.

00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:06.623
- Hello?
- Hello.

00:27:09.491 --> 00:27:11.584
- Hello?
- Hello.

00:27:11.608 --> 00:27:12.787
Hello.

00:27:29.265 --> 00:27:30.671
Excuse me.

00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:32.725
You can't come in here.

00:27:32.749 --> 00:27:34.741
Only the auditor knows the password…

00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:39.417
Why would I be aware of the password
and occupy the team leader's seat?

00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:40.464
Goo Han Soo.

00:27:40.488 --> 00:27:41.768
Because you are the team leader…

00:27:43.144 --> 00:27:46.527
How did you know my name…

00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:49.505
Joined JU Construction
with chin-up in July 2022.

00:27:49.529 --> 00:27:51.746
Was appointed to the audit office
through a friendship with the last team leader.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:56.509
Has been working for 6 months and told you can transfer to the Florida branch
after working in the audit office for 3 years.

00:27:56.533 --> 00:27:58.798
Did you do background check on me?

00:28:03.197 --> 00:28:05.138
Let's go in two and a half years!

00:28:05.162 --> 00:28:08.747
I won't forget the team leader and senior
who got me into the audit office.

00:28:22.324 --> 00:28:24.457
Good morning. Oh?

00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:26.823
Seems like everyone is here.

00:28:26.847 --> 00:28:31.043
Starting today, he will be working
with us in the audit office.

00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:32.231
- Mr. Shin…
- Shin Cha Il.

00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:34.512
Mr. Shin Cha Il.

00:28:34.536 --> 00:28:38.614
This is the audit team's Deputy Chief
Yeom Kyung Seok, Manager Ok Ga Jang, and…

00:28:38.638 --> 00:28:41.504
I know. Mr. Moon Sang Ho, Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:45.857
Well, let's figure it out step by step...

00:28:45.881 --> 00:28:46.966
Let's get into a meeting.

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:54.948
Why are you cutting off
when your superior is talking?

00:28:54.972 --> 00:28:57.091
I don't get it, really.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.380
Get in there, Mr. Director!

00:29:05.973 --> 00:29:10.331
I already introduce myself at the cafeteria,
so let's discuss about the audit schedule right away.

00:29:10.355 --> 00:29:15.116
On January 16, we will audit the Tower Crane
that was constructed among the crowd apartments.

00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:17.896
Why are we auditing that?

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.693
Yeah, the injured already got treatment for the injured,
and we've given insurance for Tower Crane.

00:29:21.717 --> 00:29:23.420
It has been wrapped up.

00:29:23.444 --> 00:29:25.279
I don't think you know yet,

00:29:25.303 --> 00:29:28.366
conducting an audit at this point incurs a business loss
because the construction has already resumed.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.085
- Are you aware of the cause behind the collapse?
- The collapse?

00:29:31.109 --> 00:29:33.928
It was on the news
that the wind blew so hard that it collapsed…

00:29:33.952 --> 00:29:38.975
There was a strong wind warning on January 16th, but during the time of the accident,
the wind speed was less than 10 meters per second.

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:41.647
Tower Cranes are not that weak in wind-proof.

00:29:41.671 --> 00:29:43.171
Then why did you say that?

00:29:45.812 --> 00:29:47.616
Are you asking me that now?

00:29:48.882 --> 00:29:51.033
You're being complacence and incompetent,

00:29:52.763 --> 00:29:53.864
being lazy.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.794
Auditors,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.389
hiding the cause of the accident
means there's a fraud.

00:30:03.413 --> 00:30:05.983
I've never seen a rootless
and unbranched fraud.

00:30:06.007 --> 00:30:07.858
I'll find them all and cut them out.

00:30:09.171 --> 00:30:10.545
What should I start with?

00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:13.221
Let's start with an interview
with the field director.

00:30:13.245 --> 00:30:15.957
The field director didn't do anything wrong,
why are you interviewing him.

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:18.101
Is there any proof
that he's not doing anything wrong?

00:30:18.645 --> 00:30:21.121
He's not the type to hide
and do anything like that.

00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:22.402
I'm asking for a proof.

00:30:22.426 --> 00:30:23.605
That's because,

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.566
I trust the field director.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.292
- I don't believe him.
- But…

00:30:29.316 --> 00:30:32.605
From now on, we will reorganize
according to our work capabilities.

00:30:32.629 --> 00:30:35.293
Prepare all the materials
related to Tower Crane.

00:30:36.348 --> 00:30:38.246
How long should I set the period?

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.934
From the groundbreaking date of the site
to the date of the accident.

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:42.848
Mr. Goo Han Soo, please follow me.

00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:43.902
Me?

00:30:49.161 --> 00:30:50.247
Yoon Seo Jin,

00:30:51.356 --> 00:30:53.442
You're very motivated, I see.

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:06.927
Well, I missed the timing earlier.

00:31:06.951 --> 00:31:12.245
Mr. Bae Young Sik has worked
at our company for more than 20 years.

00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:17.268
He has been there since before we change the CEO,
and he's so good with his work too.

00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:19.808
- Goo Han Soo!
- Yes.

00:31:19.832 --> 00:31:22.057
You don't suit to work in audit team.

00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:24.032
Change to different department.

00:31:24.738 --> 00:31:26.893
- Sorry?
- I'll give you a week.

00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:27.941
Change your department.

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:49.206
No, what did I do wrong? Please tell me.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.830
No, you have to tell me so I can…

00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:05.617
Where is the field director's seat?

00:32:06.617 --> 00:32:07.945
Hello.

00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:09.945
But who are you to come all of a sudden?

00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:12.609
He's the new team leader.

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:13.960
Hello.

00:32:13.984 --> 00:32:15.718
It's over there.

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:27.324
Doesn't he have a desktop?

00:32:27.348 --> 00:32:29.793
Mr. Bae uses a laptop.

00:32:33.448 --> 00:32:34.754
Oh, no.

00:32:34.778 --> 00:32:36.652
What are you doing, sir?

00:32:36.676 --> 00:32:38.520
You can't do that when the owner is not here.

00:32:49.204 --> 00:32:50.250
What is it?

00:32:51.195 --> 00:32:52.992
Why are you searching
through someone else's desk?

00:32:53.016 --> 00:32:55.243
Please fill out the consent form
and let's start an interview.

00:32:55.267 --> 00:32:59.732
I'm so busy with the wall construction,
what is this all about?

00:33:04.962 --> 00:33:06.462
Sir!

00:33:06.486 --> 00:33:08.712
What's wrong with you all of a sudden, huh?

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:10.064
Please bring me the laptop.

00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:13.611
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

00:33:19.417 --> 00:33:20.871
Mr. Bae, where are you going?

00:33:24.698 --> 00:33:25.746
Mr. Bae!

00:33:29.637 --> 00:33:32.247
Mr. Bae, where are you going? Wait for me.

00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:34.317
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:36.535
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

00:33:36.559 --> 00:33:38.855
Mr. Bae, stop for a second.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.355
Mr. Bae, please talk to me.

00:33:47.512 --> 00:33:48.527
Mr. Bae,

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:52.082
Really.

00:33:52.106 --> 00:33:53.176
Mr. Bae,

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.301
why are you running away?

00:33:59.325 --> 00:34:03.394
- Hey, Han Soo, how could you do this to me?
- What?

00:34:03.418 --> 00:34:06.480
You come in with new team leader
and wants to audit me?

00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:07.941
No, it's not that.

00:34:07.965 --> 00:34:09.972
Dont get closer.

00:34:11.262 --> 00:34:12.284
Mr. Bae, it's me Han Soo.

00:34:12.308 --> 00:34:13.739
I said, don't come.

00:34:13.763 --> 00:34:15.207
Mr. Bae Young Sik!

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.610
Why did you lie about the cause
of the collapse of Tower Crane?

00:34:29.941 --> 00:34:31.549
Why are you asking me that?

00:34:31.573 --> 00:34:34.354
I'm asking because you're the person
being responsible for the site.

00:34:34.378 --> 00:34:36.502
I just did what I was ordered to.

00:34:36.526 --> 00:34:38.311
Who ordered it?

00:34:38.335 --> 00:34:40.178
The deputy manager never said he approve it.

00:34:48.678 --> 00:34:50.380
Give me the laptop, please.

00:34:50.404 --> 00:34:51.521
Why would I give it to you?

00:34:51.545 --> 00:34:54.068
It's not yours. It's from the company.

00:34:55.037 --> 00:34:57.646
Let me talk to him.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.654
It seems like Mr. Bae is misunderstanding…

00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:04.334
something…

00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:10.476
Han Soo, what's wrong with that guy?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.242
Sir, let me talk to him, please?

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.250
Mr. Bae!

00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:23.549
I think it's because it's rusty. Call 911!

00:35:23.573 --> 00:35:25.017
Get someone!

00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:27.361
Wait, it's Mr. Bae!

00:35:27.385 --> 00:35:29.306
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

00:35:42.477 --> 00:35:44.637
Even the police can't come like this
without a warrant.

00:35:45.313 --> 00:35:47.219
What if you hurt someone?

00:35:54.016 --> 00:35:55.078
Are you okay?

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:59.875
I'll send the laptop to forensics
and conduct an audit on the financials.

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:02.868
We are conducting a full re-investigation
of the Tower Crane accident.

00:36:02.892 --> 00:36:04.620
Mr. Bae, it needs to be stabilized first.

00:36:05.418 --> 00:36:07.495
What caused the Tower Crane to collapse?

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:10.175
Tell me now. It will reduce
the level of disciplinary action.

00:36:10.199 --> 00:36:11.495
Please stop.

00:36:12.613 --> 00:36:15.218
Do you really have to ask him that now?

00:36:18.016 --> 00:36:20.945
I'll bring the staff members on site to you.

00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:23.078
- Han Soo.
- Yes?

00:36:23.102 --> 00:36:26.016
I prefer a single room.
Give me a single room.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.203
Is there any reason
why you shouldn't be with the field staff?

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.263
- Answer me.
- Han Soo, this man is killing me.

00:36:40.287 --> 00:36:41.814
Give me a single room quickly.

00:36:41.838 --> 00:36:42.939
Please help me.

00:36:49.796 --> 00:36:53.099
Mr. Bae is here? Is he hurt?

00:36:53.123 --> 00:36:54.748
It's not a big injury.

00:36:54.772 --> 00:36:57.209
Why is the Mr. Bae avoiding the field staff?

00:36:57.233 --> 00:36:59.537
Probably because he's sorry.

00:36:59.561 --> 00:37:03.463
JU Construction promised us a full-time position,
but he couldn't keep it.

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:06.727
Did Mr. Bae ask for money and valuables
under the pretext of a full-time employee?

00:37:09.245 --> 00:37:14.003
Oh my, he's the one who pays for the taxi
when you go to a company dinner, what more could you ask for.

00:37:14.027 --> 00:37:17.636
He's also the one who saved Mr. Choi
during the Tower Crane accident.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.175
Who's the driver of Tower Crane?

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.261
He was discharged from the hospital.
He was given a single room.

00:37:21.285 --> 00:37:22.386
He's already discharged?

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.496
Mr. Bae handled it well,
so he only broke one leg.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.113
I think you misunderstood something.

00:37:29.137 --> 00:37:33.911
Mr. Bae even asked the executive director
to let make us a full-time employee.

00:37:33.935 --> 00:37:35.599
Although it didn't go well…

00:37:35.623 --> 00:37:38.060
Mr. Bae really is a nice guy.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:44.943
Han Soo, I'm really sorry earlier.

00:37:44.967 --> 00:37:48.513
I got scared since you say
I'm going to be audited.

00:37:49.224 --> 00:37:51.116
What happened to my laptop?

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.654
The team leader took all the smashed pieces.

00:37:54.776 --> 00:37:57.705
What's going on? Tell me.

00:38:00.265 --> 00:38:03.557
Is there really a separate cause
for Tower Crane's collapse?

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:06.053
No, that's not it.

00:38:07.077 --> 00:38:12.889
If it's a natural disaster,
we can shorten the resumption of construction.

00:38:12.913 --> 00:38:16.858
This is all discussed with the higher ups.
Do you think I decide all of that by myself?

00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:19.342
Oh, it hurts.

00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:20.678
- Han Soo.
- Yes?

00:38:20.702 --> 00:38:23.130
Don't let anyone visit me.

00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:24.591
Yes, sure.

00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:34.742
Why did you do that?

00:38:34.766 --> 00:38:36.477
A person got hurt.

00:38:36.501 --> 00:38:38.570
Is an audit more important than people?
It can't be more of a priority.

00:38:38.594 --> 00:38:40.851
This is the result of complacent audit
from the beginning.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:44.844
He wanted to shorten the resumption
of Tower Crane construction.

00:38:44.868 --> 00:38:46.172
He said he was ordered to do so.

00:38:46.196 --> 00:38:48.500
- I'll do the interview.
- Let Mr. Bae rest.

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:54.406
Did you get a bribe from Mr. Bae?

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:55.430
What?

00:38:57.224 --> 00:38:58.624
What are you talking about…

00:39:02.702 --> 00:39:03.896
It's Shin Cha Il.

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:07.876
Yes, okay.

00:39:24.766 --> 00:39:26.273
Here is your coffee.

00:39:27.188 --> 00:39:28.812
When you're having a hard time…

00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:32.851
Do you agree if I say
that my worklife is going to be twisted?

00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:34.485
- Of course.
- Thank you.

00:39:35.477 --> 00:39:36.539
Have a drink.

00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:40.271
How can you put an outsider
on the audit team? Huh?

00:39:48.904 --> 00:39:50.037
What happened?

00:39:50.061 --> 00:39:51.701
You don't look good.

00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:04.445
What do you know about digging up work?

00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:06.359
There's an audit because there's a fraud.

00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:11.735
Fraud? The information provided
is supervised by the vice president.

00:40:11.759 --> 00:40:15.181
It's the vice president's decision
to publish an article about a natural disaster.

00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:17.280
It's not your job to mess with the spokesman.

00:40:17.304 --> 00:40:19.700
I'll tell the vice president when I meet him,

00:40:19.724 --> 00:40:21.075
that the decision was wrong.

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:22.357
This guy.

00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:25.513
Don't poke around and stop it now,

00:40:26.373 --> 00:40:28.122
and bring me Mr. Bae's laptop.

00:40:31.644 --> 00:40:35.534
How did you know I had the laptop?

00:40:36.288 --> 00:40:37.842
Did Mr. Bae told you?

00:40:37.866 --> 00:40:39.758
What if he does?

00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:42.102
Then it became a connection
between the executive director and Mr. Bae.

00:40:42.126 --> 00:40:43.961
What? This fucker.

00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:48.711
Do you know who I am?

00:40:49.616 --> 00:40:53.014
I've been working with JU Construction
since the chairman's time.

00:40:53.038 --> 00:40:58.459
Did you promise Mr. Bae Young Sik
that you would hire the workers as full-time employees?

00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:00.803
Was there a price?

00:41:01.623 --> 00:41:04.271
Wow, this is driving me crazy.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.342
You look very funny at me.

00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.162
Just bring me the laptop.

00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:12.118
Yes, I'll bring it to you…

00:41:13.399 --> 00:41:17.422
after I asked the forensics
to find out what's in it.

00:41:22.304 --> 00:41:23.718
No, that punk!

00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:34.263
Mr. Bae's 7th and 8th ribs were broken
and his shin was cracked.

00:41:34.287 --> 00:41:37.818
Do you know what he says to me
for committing such ruthless violence?

00:41:37.842 --> 00:41:40.740
"Change to other departments".
He said I didn't suit being an auditor.

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:42.091
Does this make sense? Really?

00:41:42.115 --> 00:41:45.612
It's worse than I expected.
Oh, my head hurts.

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.331
Where are the headache pills?

00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:50.354
This is a misjudgment.

00:41:50.378 --> 00:41:54.076
I think we need to find out
why Mr. Bae ran away.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.823
He said he was scared
when Mr. Shin suddenly came to audit him.

00:41:56.847 --> 00:42:00.144
Of course he was scared.
Because he might be blamed for it.

00:42:00.168 --> 00:42:03.254
He fell from the 3rd floor
because of the team leader.

00:42:03.278 --> 00:42:05.019
It's the third floor. That height…

00:42:06.029 --> 00:42:07.560
Director Seo Gil Pyo came up to me.

00:42:07.584 --> 00:42:10.771
Please upload all the due date, items,
and payment documents.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.600
What about the executive director?

00:42:27.312 --> 00:42:30.757
How can someone who doesn't even know
how to audit be the audit team leader?

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:31.936
What do you think?

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.928
I've never had a hard day like today.

00:42:33.952 --> 00:42:36.069
I think today is the hardest day
since I joined the company.

00:42:36.093 --> 00:42:39.085
- Look. My eyes are going to pop out, right?
- What should I do?

00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:41.624
You don't know? It was always like that.

00:42:41.648 --> 00:42:44.980
- How about a cold beer?
- That's nice.

00:42:45.004 --> 00:42:46.214
No, listen to me.

00:42:46.238 --> 00:42:48.808
- I told you, the team leader is weird.
- Good job, everyone.

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.058
Ah, these punks.

00:42:53.552 --> 00:42:56.644
Hey, don't worry. I'll take care of everything.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

00:42:56.668 --> 00:42:58.555
- I'll get going.
- Goodbye.

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:00.161
Seo Jin, how will you go home?

00:43:00.185 --> 00:43:01.605
I'll take the bus.

00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:02.698
Let's go together.

00:43:03.933 --> 00:43:07.159
But I really don't understand.

00:43:07.183 --> 00:43:11.834
How can you appoint someone like that as the team leader
of the audit office? He's a total gangster.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.001
The problem started when Mr. Bae fled.

00:43:16.025 --> 00:43:18.986
I told you, He got scared
when he heard about auditing.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.370
If there's nothing to hide,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:43:22.553 --> 00:43:24.935
Do you doubt Mr. Bae, Yoon Seo Jin?

00:43:26.338 --> 00:43:29.157
Then, do you believe Mr. Bae?

00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:31.126
- Of course.
- Without any proof?

00:43:33.274 --> 00:43:37.368
I think the team leader was right.
You don't fit the audit department.

00:43:47.098 --> 00:43:50.191
What?
Look at the executive director's work history?

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.942
I really want him
to be just a complete cornerstone.

00:43:53.966 --> 00:43:55.864
Does he really wanna die?

00:43:55.888 --> 00:43:57.880
He was so anxious to die.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.197
But why did the president hire an outsider
as a team leader?

00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:03.330
Why do you think so?

00:44:03.354 --> 00:44:05.695
It's because all the insiders
are vice president's people.

00:44:05.719 --> 00:44:09.023
That's why he brings such a nuthead
like Shin Cha Il inside.

00:44:09.047 --> 00:44:11.547
He wants to hold the audit office in his hands.

00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:16.040
How's the atmosphere at work these days?
Isn't it a mess?

00:44:16.064 --> 00:44:18.283
We have to kick Shin Cha Il out.

00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:21.729
Then, vice president Yeom
will naturally get a chance.

00:44:21.753 --> 00:44:26.269
Sir, who am I? It's been four years
since I've worked in the audit office.

00:44:26.293 --> 00:44:29.502
Once you set a target,
it's not that hard to win them.

00:44:29.526 --> 00:44:32.598
I don't need a long word, I need a summary.

00:44:32.622 --> 00:44:34.887
Shin Cha Il has Mr. Bae's laptop.

00:44:34.911 --> 00:44:36.488
Retrieve it right away.

00:44:36.512 --> 00:44:39.418
Laptop? I'll bring it directly to you.

00:44:39.442 --> 00:44:41.380
Don't just talk big.

00:44:42.756 --> 00:44:43.987
Please believe me.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.394
Just wait and see.

00:44:49.649 --> 00:44:51.073
I'm home.

00:44:51.097 --> 00:44:53.585
Han Soo, have a beer with Kyung Ryeol.

00:44:53.609 --> 00:44:57.078
Oh, it has been a long time
since I last saw you.

00:44:57.102 --> 00:44:58.457
Hello, sir.

00:44:58.481 --> 00:45:01.497
Mr. Ahn, why are you eating so slow?

00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:04.582
He's serving as a colonel, our Mr. Goo.

00:45:04.606 --> 00:45:08.888
Since we're gathered like this,
it reminds me of when we worked together in the office.

00:45:08.912 --> 00:45:12.770
That time when they were dating in the company.

00:45:13.818 --> 00:45:16.613
By the way, didn't you go to Vietnam?

00:45:16.637 --> 00:45:18.801
That's your mom's story.

00:45:18.825 --> 00:45:21.017
He went around looking for investors.

00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:23.658
Fortunately, the factory is going well now.

00:45:23.682 --> 00:45:27.220
She don't even know that
and keep saying to kill him…

00:45:27.244 --> 00:45:29.127
Just eat this.

00:45:29.151 --> 00:45:32.586
I deserved to be killed.
I suddenly showed up after two years.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.351
Hey, if you hadn't lent me 30 million won,
I wouldn't have been able to go around meeting investors.

00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:39.066
Thank you very much.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.777
Thank you, sir.

00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:44.491
Do your business well.
I really didn't expect your return.

00:45:44.515 --> 00:45:46.788
He can't be trusted.

00:45:47.585 --> 00:45:51.702
Dad? Did you know he'd come back?

00:45:51.726 --> 00:45:54.450
Of course, because I believe in Kyung Ryeol.

00:45:54.474 --> 00:45:55.496
What's the proof?

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.090
The depth of faith is up to me.

00:45:58.114 --> 00:46:00.364
That's why I'm the proof.

00:46:00.388 --> 00:46:03.067
Oh, that's cool.

00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:04.674
That's what my manager said.

00:46:22.278 --> 00:46:25.181
You should've be careful. Oh, my.

00:46:27.564 --> 00:46:30.957
Take this.
So you won't step on it like last time.

00:46:30.981 --> 00:46:32.765
Your shoes are broken. Wear these.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.418
Mr. Bae! Thank you.

00:46:38.445 --> 00:46:42.468
Yes, the depth of faith is up to me.

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:46.784
I'm the proof. I'll prove it.

00:47:01.774 --> 00:47:03.101
Do you know the reason for the collapse?

00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:05.019
The wind blew so hard that it collapsed…

00:47:05.043 --> 00:47:07.820
During the time of the accident,
the wind speed was less than 10 meters per second.

00:47:07.844 --> 00:47:10.073
Why did you lie about the cause
of Tower Crane collapse?

00:47:10.097 --> 00:47:12.424
I just did what I was ordered.

00:47:12.448 --> 00:47:13.784
Who ordered you?

00:47:14.797 --> 00:47:18.171
Don't get involved and stop it now.
I'm JU Construction History.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:45.403
I've never seen a person like that before.

00:47:45.427 --> 00:47:48.715
If the corporate hierarchy collapses,
aren't they all going to fall apart?

00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:50.714
Is there a place
where it's going to fall apart?

00:47:50.738 --> 00:47:54.219
It's been five years since my father died and turned bankrupt.
I don't even know where the floor is anymore.

00:47:54.243 --> 00:47:56.365
I'm completely disoriented.
I can't even tell where the ground is.

00:47:56.389 --> 00:47:57.873
You're going to get back on your feet.

00:47:57.897 --> 00:48:02.278
Yes, that's why I hired someone like Shin Cha Il
as the audit team leader.

00:48:02.302 --> 00:48:03.630
I need a change.

00:48:03.654 --> 00:48:06.810
Then you can just hire him.
Why did you have an interview?

00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:08.583
Are you warning me?

00:48:08.607 --> 00:48:10.575
To endure his insults, calling me a rat?

00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:17.329
There will be a problem
when the vice president gets back.

00:48:22.212 --> 00:48:25.190
I'm the president, executive director Seo.

00:48:31.104 --> 00:48:32.768
I'll leave now.

00:48:44.149 --> 00:48:47.856
It's nothing difficult. Just tell me
what you're doing like yesterday.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.532
You know you'll be kicked out of the audit office
if the team leader said so, right?

00:48:51.556 --> 00:48:53.837
It's not just you,
even Mr. Bae is going to be kicked out.

00:48:55.712 --> 00:48:58.411
What should I do?

00:48:58.435 --> 00:48:59.755
This is a war.

00:49:01.701 --> 00:49:03.968
Oh, what about the team leader?

00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:06.172
It seemed like you were going to be
a subcontractor of Tower Crane.

00:49:06.196 --> 00:49:08.265
Oh really? Good job.

00:49:08.289 --> 00:49:09.289
Yes?

00:49:14.665 --> 00:49:15.999
This is a war.

00:49:16.023 --> 00:49:19.030
Get Mr. Bae's laptop if you want to end it
with just one nuclear bomb.

00:49:19.054 --> 00:49:20.327
If you bring the laptop,

00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:21.889
- You'll be transferred to Florida.
- Transferred.

00:49:21.913 --> 00:49:23.570
- Mr. Bae can return to his position.
- Return.

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:25.829
- Team leader, out.
- Out.

00:49:25.853 --> 00:49:26.843
- Got it?
- Yes.

00:49:26.867 --> 00:49:28.399
- You can do it, right?
- Yes.

00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:29.431
Good.

00:49:35.482 --> 00:49:37.886
You're going to the Myeong Tower right?
Let's go together.

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.234
You don't know the owner
of the Myeong Tower well.

00:49:42.258 --> 00:49:44.847
I know him well
because I've received work support in the past.

00:49:44.871 --> 00:49:47.785
I'll introduce you to the team leader.

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:55.369
Yes, I restored it to it's original state
like before it was smashed…

00:49:55.393 --> 00:49:56.744
and I removed the password.

00:50:53.537 --> 00:50:54.807
No way!

00:51:25.037 --> 00:51:26.037
Sir…

00:51:27.287 --> 00:51:29.607
Do you have Tower Crane info
on the laptop?

00:51:31.577 --> 00:51:32.817
You don't need to know.

00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:38.397
You stated that I am not the right match
for this position.

00:51:40.087 --> 00:51:41.827
Could you explain why?

00:51:46.087 --> 00:51:47.987
You trust people, don't you?

00:51:49.447 --> 00:51:51.183
Is that a problem?

00:51:51.207 --> 00:51:54.903
JU Construction can't be handled
with just document checks.

00:51:54.927 --> 00:51:58.563
Numerous holes are already present.
Holes gnawed by rats.

00:51:58.587 --> 00:52:02.363
We need to question people
so as to catch those rats.

00:52:02.387 --> 00:52:06.477
You can't pull that off with blind trust
based solely on familiarity.

00:52:09.987 --> 00:52:11.447
So I don't need you.

00:52:15.207 --> 00:52:16.417
Then…

00:52:18.577 --> 00:52:20.617
Do you suspect everyone?

00:52:23.127 --> 00:52:24.207
Well… then

00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:26.987
you must be terribly lonely.

00:53:09.607 --> 00:53:14.293
Trolleys jib is from Germany,
hoisting mechanism is from Taiwan.

00:53:14.317 --> 00:53:14.933
And no manufacturer for the counterweight.

00:53:14.957 --> 00:53:16.393
Each component boasts
a distinct year of manufacture.

00:53:16.417 --> 00:53:19.617
This type of Tower Crane is called
Frankenstein Tower.

00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:24.763
You're talking about such a gruesome name!

00:53:24.787 --> 00:53:28.883
You rented out makeshift products
as if they're finished goods.

00:53:28.907 --> 00:53:31.563
How much did you give to Seo Gil Pyo?

00:53:31.587 --> 00:53:35.377
Come on! Stop talking nonsense!

00:53:45.937 --> 00:53:47.383
There are two options.

00:53:47.407 --> 00:53:49.243
First, admit to false delivery and testify.

00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:51.823
Second, deny embezzlement
and face criminal prosecution.

00:53:51.847 --> 00:53:54.887
If you choose the second one,
Myung Tower will have to shut down.

00:53:57.797 --> 00:54:02.293
Can you step out for a moment?
I need to talk to him personally.

00:54:02.317 --> 00:54:03.317
Please wait outside.

00:54:43.527 --> 00:54:47.523
Take it easy, just tell me
what they're up to like yesterday.

00:54:47.547 --> 00:54:51.463
It's up to him whether you get kicked
out of the audit department.

00:54:51.487 --> 00:54:53.767
It's not just you. Mr. Bae, either.

00:55:41.697 --> 00:55:43.457
Please let it slide.

00:55:45.017 --> 00:55:47.583
Please, I beg you, only this time.

00:55:47.607 --> 00:55:50.513
If this gets exposed, we're to be closed down.

00:55:50.537 --> 00:55:53.713
I'll make sure to issue genuine certificates…

00:55:53.737 --> 00:55:55.393
Only two options.

00:55:55.417 --> 00:55:57.117
I'll wait for your answer.

00:56:49.497 --> 00:56:51.353
He has been discharged.

00:56:51.377 --> 00:56:55.547
Thanks to Mr. Bae, he only broke one leg.

00:57:05.947 --> 00:57:08.617
Sir, Mr. Shin Cha Il has visited here.

00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:39.353
Aren't we returning to the office, huh?

00:57:39.377 --> 00:57:40.383
Going to the hospital.

00:57:40.407 --> 00:57:41.437
Hospital?

00:57:42.517 --> 00:57:44.187
You're a declining visitor.

00:58:01.347 --> 00:58:02.377
Ugh!

00:58:17.687 --> 00:58:19.027
Get out!

00:58:20.077 --> 00:58:21.097
Get out!

00:58:24.057 --> 00:58:25.467
I said get out!

00:58:28.387 --> 00:58:29.657
Hey! Get out!

00:58:34.237 --> 00:58:37.213
Get out! Out of the car!

00:58:37.237 --> 00:58:38.497
What the…

00:58:47.777 --> 00:58:49.267
Catch him!

00:59:37.587 --> 00:59:39.333
Father!

00:59:39.357 --> 00:59:40.847
Please help!

00:59:42.487 --> 00:59:43.807
Father!

00:59:46.567 --> 00:59:47.667
Father!

00:59:50.347 --> 00:59:52.577
Sir, sir!

00:59:55.207 --> 00:59:56.267
Sir!

01:00:02.317 --> 01:00:03.497
Mr. Shin!

01:00:14.147 --> 01:00:15.247
Are you ok?

01:00:24.627 --> 01:00:26.047
Where is the laptop?

01:00:27.077 --> 01:00:28.753
Looks like they took it.

01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:30.427
Even the black box is not here.

01:00:32.757 --> 01:00:33.897
Please stop the car.

01:00:34.937 --> 01:00:36.193
You need to go to the hospital.

01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:38.947
You really should get checked for a concussion.

01:00:40.097 --> 01:00:41.367
Stop the car.

01:00:49.517 --> 01:00:50.517
Let's go.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.283
Hello.

01:01:39.307 --> 01:01:42.587
Sir, I got word
that Mr.Bae disappeared from the hospital.

01:02:05.707 --> 01:02:07.587
It's obvious now.

01:02:10.287 --> 01:02:12.777
Speak of the devil, and he really appears.

01:02:15.597 --> 01:02:17.263
Give me the laptop.

01:02:17.287 --> 01:02:18.683
What the hell are you talking about?

01:02:18.707 --> 01:02:20.823
In your time, violence may have worked.

01:02:20.847 --> 01:02:23.203
But now, there are many eyes
watching and rational laws,

01:02:23.227 --> 01:02:25.743
so you could be criminally punished.

01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:27.213
- Hey!
- Mr. Shin.

01:02:27.237 --> 01:02:30.903
Even if it's a disciplinary decision,
that's inevitable, it's pointless.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:33.193
There's such a thing as aggravated punishment.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.883
Mr. Shin, too rude!

01:02:34.907 --> 01:02:36.163
Just leave him.

01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:37.827
Let's wait and see.

01:02:39.007 --> 01:02:41.713
You were the final decision-maker
for purchasing the Tower Crane.

01:02:41.737 --> 01:02:46.013
You purchased it
with an unclear manufacturing year at full price.

01:02:46.037 --> 01:02:49.573
The difference was recovered by you,
from Myung Tower.

01:02:49.597 --> 01:02:53.293
That weak Tower Crane finally injured someone,

01:02:53.317 --> 01:02:58.857
and you claimed the cause of the case
was the wind to cover up the…

01:02:59.697 --> 01:03:00.827
That's fun.

01:03:02.087 --> 01:03:04.377
You're a good comedian.

01:03:05.327 --> 01:03:06.483
Can you prove it?

01:03:06.507 --> 01:03:07.857
Please give me the laptop.

01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:13.993
You dare to talk about something
you can't prove.

01:03:14.017 --> 01:03:16.583
I'll bring you up at the board of directors
for defamation of character.

01:03:16.607 --> 01:03:19.553
You will be the shortest-lived audit leader.

01:03:19.577 --> 01:03:22.323
I've ever had.

01:03:22.347 --> 01:03:26.707
Someone is hiding the injury of
the Tower Crane operator.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:33.067
I think it's Mr. Bae. What do you think, sir?

01:03:49.557 --> 01:03:51.613
The vice president is over there.

01:03:51.637 --> 01:03:53.067
You are doomed.

01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:55.557
You'd better be careful.

01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:23.377
Oh, hey.

01:04:26.317 --> 01:04:28.167
Good to see you.

01:04:29.167 --> 01:04:30.283
Are you alright?

01:04:30.307 --> 01:04:32.323
Yeah.

01:04:32.347 --> 01:04:33.827
This is Director Yang.

01:04:38.427 --> 01:04:40.513
Mr. Shin, say hello to him.

01:04:40.537 --> 01:04:43.203
Hurry and come!

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:44.213
Who is he?

01:04:44.237 --> 01:04:46.777
He's the new audit team leader.

01:04:47.807 --> 01:04:49.007
The audit team leader?

01:04:56.027 --> 01:04:57.597
What's with that jerk's stare?
